# 2D Ising Model using Metropolis Algorithm

## Run 2D Ising Model Simulation
To run the Metropolis algorithm, you will need numba, pickle, and numpy. Run the command `python3 ising.py`. This took about 4-5 hours on a MacBook Pro. The program will store the measurements as `.pkl` files in the `out` directory.

## Make Analysis Plots
Create the analysis plots using the command `python3 analysis.py`. The plots will be saved in the `plots` directory.
